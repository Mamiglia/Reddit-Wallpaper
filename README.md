Bored by your old static wallpaper? Want to see something new? Well my boy this is the right place for you. 
This magnificent tool automatically downloads and sets up a wallpaper from the website reddit!
It allows you to decide the period of time after you get bored by a wallpaper and changes it, and you won't need to move a single muscle.
Best thing of all, it applies wallpapers using a non-repetitive pattern - meaning that it's unlikely that you will ever see the same wallpaper twice.
And it has so many more settings to customize!

Work in progress! But it does work and is stable!

**Main Features:**
- [Easy install and update](https://github.com/Mamiglia/Reddit-Wallpaper/blob/main/Installer/Installation.md)
- No setup required, just install, and it will start doing everything by itself
- Query reddit's API with the specified parameters
- Select the wallpaper to download through a non-repetitive pattern
- Automatically apply such wallpaper 
- GUI to control settings
- System Tray
- Supports galleries and crossposts!
- Dark Theme
- Select only wallpapers with a sufficient resolution. All resolutions supported!

#### Disclaimer
I need help! I'm kinda a beginner in Java development and in general as a software developer. For sure this project is full of hidden bugs, bad practices, unoptimal implementations and so on. Furthermore, the program has me as the only tester.
I need help, I need feedbacks, I need people to tell me that they like this/dislike that. Only with such support this tool will get better

**Known Bugs:**
