Bored by your old static wallpaper? Want to see something new? Well my boy this is the right place for you. 
This magnificent tool automatically downloads and sets up a wallpaper from the website reddit!
It allows you to decide the period of time after you get bored by a wallpaper and changes it, and you won't need to move a single muscle.
Best thing of all, it applies wallpapers using a non-repetitive pattern - meaning that it's unlikely that you will ever see the same wallpaper twice.
And it has so many more settings to customize!


**Main Features:**
- [Easy install and update](https://github.com/Mamiglia/Reddit-Wallpaper/blob/main/Installer/Installation.md)
- No setup required, just install, and it will start doing everything by itself
- Query reddit's API with the specified parameters
- Select the wallpaper to download through a non-repetitive pattern
- Automatically apply such wallpaper 
- GUI to control settings
- System Tray
- Supports galleries and crossposts!
- Dark Theme
- Select only wallpapers with a sufficient resolution. All resolutions supported!

#### Disclaimer
I need help! I'm kinda a beginner in Java development and in general as a software developer. For sure this project is full of hidden bugs, bad practices, unoptimal implementations and so on. Furthermore, the program has me as the only tester.
I need help, I need feedbacks, I need people to tell me that they like this/dislike that. Only with such support this tool will get better

**Known Bugs:**
- pinterest galleries aren't supported (yet)
- <del>Changing the wallpaper destination folder doesn't take effect until the program is restarted</del>
- <del>NSFW queries fail</del>

**ToDo:**
- [x] Add a way to check for updates
- [x] Improve memory usage (was ca. 200MB) -> improved to 150MB
- [ ] Add Linux support!
- [x] Add an option to search from single subreddits with specific flairs
- [x] Feature request: add "save" button that saves the wallpapers you like in a specific folder
- [x] Feature request: add option to apply different wallpapers for different monitors
- [x] Feature request: add the title of the post to the image (somewhere)
- [x] Feature request: add blacklist option for wallpapers


# Development setup

After gradle import, in Intellij Idea, go to <kbd>Build, Execution, Deployment</kbd> > <kbd>Build Tools</kbd> > <kbd>Gradle</kbd> and set <kbd>Build and run</kbd> to use `Intellij IDEA`, not `Gradle`.

This is needed because Gradle plugin does not support generating GUI designer code.
