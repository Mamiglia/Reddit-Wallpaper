Here's a list of useful information of practices I do when developing this software.

### Java Version
At the moment I use AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.10.9 for development. In any case it works fine with any AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.x, and it should work with any version of Java 11.x (not tested) 

# Development setup

After gradle import, in Intellij Idea, go to <kbd>Build, Execution, Deployment</kbd> > <kbd>Build Tools</kbd> > <kbd>Gradle</kbd> and set <kbd>Build and run</kbd> to use `Intellij IDEA`, not `Gradle`.

This is needed because Gradle plugin does not support generating GUI designer code.

### Artifacts  
The full runnable JAR is generated by the gradle task <kbd>fatJar</kbd>

### Releases
The actual exe release is generated thanks to [install4j](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html) that gave me a free open-source license (thanks!).
The config file for install4j is [RW.install4j](https://github.com/Mamiglia/Reddit-Wallpaper/blob/main/.build/Install4j/RW.install4j)
